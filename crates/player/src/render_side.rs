//! The render thread (design.md "Overall Architecture", "Rendering and Skins"):
//! it owns the screen, readies it for each play on request and says when it is
//! ready, draws each play from the logic step's effects and play view at the
//! play's chart time, and draws the end screen between plays and the select
//! screen ([`crate::menu_screen`]) on song selection. The end screen's page
//! goes through a slot a newer page replaces ([`RenderLink::show_end`]), so
//! however far the render thread falls behind, one page waits for it and
//! it holds one, the graphs of each shared with the result screen's cache;
//! leaving the end screen empties the slot ([`RenderLink::clear_end`]), and
//! a signal whose page went with it draws nothing.
//! With selection the
//! chart is not known at the start: each chosen chart is loaded on request
//! ([`RenderMsg::Load`]) and stays until the next. A window target
//! paces frames on the swap chain's waitable object; an offscreen one at about
//! 60 Hz.
//!
//! A frame that fails (the surface was lost) drops the screen and tells
//! the game thread, which ends the play; the next play's preparation builds
//! the screen again, and if that fails the run ends with the error.
