//! The render thread (D8, D9): it owns the screen, readies it for each
//! play on request and says when it is ready, draws each play from the
//! logic step's effects and play view at the play's chart time, and draws
//! the end screen between plays. A window target paces frames on the swap
//! chain's waitable object; an offscreen one at about 60 Hz.
//!
//! A frame that fails (the surface was lost) drops the screen and tells
//! the game thread, which ends the play; the next play's preparation builds
//! the screen again, and if that fails the run ends with the error.
