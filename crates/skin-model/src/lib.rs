//! The skin runtime model.
//!
//! A [`Schema`] names the state a skin may read: typed fields with declared
//! ranges, timers and enumerations, each at a fixed slot. Expressions are
//! compiled against it ([`compile`]) into a [`Program`]: a postfix list of
//! pure, total integer operations whose stack depth and length are known at
//! load. Every integer subexpression is proven to stay inside `i32` at
//! compile time, and every read is clamped into its declared range, so
//! evaluating a program cannot overflow, allocates nothing and never panics.
//!
//! A frame's drawing is a [`QuadBatch`]: one ordered list of [`Quad`]s split
//! into runs wherever the blend or the clip changes.
//!
//! Expressions use integers only; floats appear only in a quad's geometry,
//! after evaluation. The cast lints below reject `as` casts that may
//! truncate, wrap, or lose the sign; they cover the library and its unit
//! tests, not integration tests.
